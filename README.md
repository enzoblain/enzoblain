Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me for feedback, collaborations, or sharing ideas! 🚀  

### Projects  
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:  

- **[Trading Algorithm with SMC Strategy](https://github.com/enzoblain/trading-algorithm)**: A Python-based algorithmic trading bot implementing the Smart Money Concept (SMC) strategy. It leverages libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data processing and analysis, enabling efficient trade execution based on market patterns. *(Work in progress 🚧: Currently optimizing performance and adding visualization features.)*

Feel free to check them out and leave feedback!  

### Wiki Repository  
📚 I maintain a **[Wiki Repository](#)** where I document and share the code and concepts I’ve learned.  
It includes:  
- 🧮 **Sorting Algorithms**: Examples and explanations of common algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and more.  
- 🔢 **Data Structures**: Practical implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Beginner-friendly implementations of algorithms like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees.  
- 🛠️ **Programming Concepts**: Snippets and notes on core programming concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, and OOP.
